# Sprint-handling-at-lablabee
Sprint duration: 3 weeks.
w1: 
- day 1: sprint palnning
- day 3: mid-week sync

- day 3: mid-week 2
- day 5 : sprint review + staging release
w3:
- day 1: Demo
- day 4: prod release
- day 5: sprint retro

New release oriented dev: a sprint can include multiple releases.


# How we are solving problems at Lablabee:
- Developers are being blocked for long time: Set daily syncs to identify blockers and find a way to deblock.
- Product team needs quick releases and waiting for the end of the sprint isn't optimal, solution: split releases from sprint, which means a sprint can have multiple releases, a release can start in sprint N and finish in sprint N+1.
- Demos were a little bit weird so we added internal demos
- Communication between web dev team and other teams about issues was random => web support rotation.
- Sprint retro to track issues and find solutions and generate actions
